Hi,
first of all, all of my comments are in portuguese!
Second, I'm just a begginer, so i know it might have quite a lot of mistakes, so pretty please, do tell me what i could change in them to make it better!
Forca is my version of the game 'Hangman', i have one for the terminal/control and another in a window with tkinter.
In the file 'Tasks', there's actually 2 projects, one of them is the task for the terminal, while the other one i used SQLAlchemy so every time the 'user' logs in it shows what they gotta do.
And the random main in the repository is a 'Wish list' that i made:)
